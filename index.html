                <p>
                  Hello! I'm a developer with a passion for building apps and websites. I work with Flutter, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user-friendly and efficient digital experiences.
                            <br>
                  I've worked on various projects, including a fitness tracking app where users can log workouts and track progress, an e-commerce website with features like product browsing and secure checkout, and a weather app that provides real-time updates. I also built my own portfolio website to showcase what I do.
                            <br>
                  I love coding because it allows me to solve problems and bring ideas to life. My focus is on writing clean, efficient code and staying current with the latest trends in technology. I enjoy working with teams to create something great, and I’m always eager to learn and take on new challenges.

              <h1 class="sub-title">My journal</h1>
              <br>
            
              <h1>How It All Began</h1>
              <p>I started my coding journey with the basics, learning C and Java to get a grip on programming fundamentals. After that, I dove into web development, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These were pretty straightforward to pick up, but I wanted to build something more complex, which led me to Bootstrap. It made designing responsive websites so much easier and allowed me to create more professional-looking projects without starting from scratch.</p>
                           <br>
              <h1>Building Projects</h1>
              <p>To put my new skills to the test, I decided to create two exciting projects: a Tesla homepage clone and a Netflix clone. Both of these projects were great learning experiences:

                Tesla Clone: I built the Tesla homepage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, focusing on replicating the sleek design and smooth layout. It was my first real dive into responsive web design, where I learned how to use media queries to make sure the layout looked perfect on any screen size.
                
                Netflix Clone: This project was a little more challenging. I used Bootstrap for the layout and JavaScript to add interactivity, like a movie carousel and hover effects. It really pushed me to understand responsive design and how different devices display content.
                
                Both of these projects helped me understand how to structure websites efficiently and how to ensure they look great across different devices. Bootstrap’s grid system and media queries were key to making everything fit properly, and I spent a lot of time figuring out how to fine-tune those elements.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h1>Learning to Adapt with Media Queries</h1>
              <p>While working on these projects, I realized how important media queries are for web development. It’s not enough to just build something that works on one device; I had to think about how users would see it on their phones, tablets, and desktops. At first, I struggled with getting the layout to adapt correctly, but with practice, I got better at writing the right queries to adjust the design. Now, I feel confident using them to make any website responsive.</p>
                   <br>

                   <h1>Transition to Flutter</h1>
                   <p>Once I got comfortable with web development, I wanted to try something new, so I moved into Flutter for mobile app development. Flutter feels different from web development because everything is built with widgets. Learning Dart as the primary language for Flutter has been a challenge, but my experience with Java has made it a bit easier to pick up.

                    I’ve just started working with Flutter widgets and learning how to manage the app’s layout. It’s been exciting to see how mobile apps come together, and I’m slowly figuring out how to manage state and use navigation within an app.</p>
                       <br><br>

                       <h1 style="color: #ff004f;">Looking Forward</h1>
                       <p>As I continue this journey, I’m excited about where it’s heading. My web development projects taught me the importance of responsive design, and now I’m applying that same mindset to mobile apps with Flutter. Every day I learn something new, and I’m looking forward to building more projects, refining my skills, and seeing what I can create next.

                        The more I code, the more confident I become—and I know this is just the beginning.</p>
